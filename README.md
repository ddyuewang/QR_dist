Q/KDB+ Quant Analytic Library

This is an open distributed library specialised in Quant Analytic written in Q/KDB+. It offers an single .so file for easy loading.

95% of the codes are written in Q/KDB+ except few are calling QML (LAPACK) for fast linear algebra computation.

This projects uses the following open source libraries. My sincere thanks for their genius invention otherwise this could not be possible. </br>
